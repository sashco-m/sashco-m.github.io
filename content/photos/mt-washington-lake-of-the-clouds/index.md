We stopped at the Lake of the Clouds hut to recharge (and buy some AMC t-shirts). At this point in the hike, the lake (and the hut) are now pretty far off in the distance (towards the middle-left). Shortly after leaving the hut, you're greeted with the [warning sign](/photos/mt-washington-warning).
