Here's part of our path up the [Ammonoosuc Ravine Trail](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/new-hampshire/mount-washington-via-ammonoosuc-ravine-trail?u=m) on Mt Washington. It was pretty challenging, being incredibly steep and entirely rocks. However, it wasn't long until we reached the [Lake of the Clouds](/photos/mt-washington-lake-of-the-clouds).
