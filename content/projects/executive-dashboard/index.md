I'm part of a group of volunteer developers for Waterloop. The goal of the team is to research, design and build the next generation of rapid transport. On the web team, we build internal tools to help manage the organization. Executive Dashboard is one of those tools; it helps leads manage recruitment, onboarding, interviews, and much more.
