[Hey](https://zombo.com/)! I'm Sashco. Find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sashco-mistelbacher/) and [Github](https://github.com/sashco-m).

Some quick facts about me:

- I'll be starting work as a full-stack dev at [Super.com](https://super.com) for my fall co-op
- I'm looking forward to climbing mountains in [New Hampshire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Hampshire) at the end of August
