[Decew Falls](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/canada/ontario/decew-falls-loop).

There's a 'secret' path down the slopes that take you to the base of the falls. I only learned about it from [this blog](https://ivebeenbit.ca/niagara-decew-falls-ontario/), I wouldn't of found it otherwise.
I've included a picture of the [rope](/photos/st-catherines-on-2) that you have to climb down to get here.
