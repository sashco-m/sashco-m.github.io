[Hey](https://zombo.com/)! I'm Sashco. With my new revamped website I'm going to be documenting my journey in tech.
Find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sashco-mistelbacher/) and [Github](https://github.com/sashco-m). The man may keep me down, but all opinions are [my own](https://workology.com/5-twitter-bio-disclaimers-social-media/).

Some quick facts about me:
- I'm currently working as a full-stack developer at [Top Hat](https://tophat.com/)
- I'm finishing up my 3rd year of Computer Science at the [University of Waterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca/)

Wow, an opportunity to write all about myself! Who doesn't love doing that? Me. It's boring! :relaxed:
