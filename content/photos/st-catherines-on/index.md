This photo has a fun story behind it. My girlfriend and I were exploring waterfalls in the St Catherines area during a trip in August 2022. One of those was [Decew Falls](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/canada/ontario/decew-falls-loop). The trail wound around the top of the falls and our view was mostly blocked by the trees.

We began to hear voices coming from the base of the falls, and we wanted to investigate. However, there was no obvious path down. As we were about to give up, I found [this blog](https://ivebeenbit.ca/niagara-decew-falls-ontario/) from a fellow waterfall enthusiast. She explained that supposedly along the trail there is a rope that you can climb down to reach the base. Sure enough, we found the rope and carefully rappelled down to take this wonderful photo.,

I've included a picture of part of the [rope](/photos/st-catherines-on-2) as well.
