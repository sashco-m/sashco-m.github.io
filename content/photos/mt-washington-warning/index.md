This sign is pretty memorable. It's no joke that Mt Washington's weather is the worst in the world, and held the record for the [strongest winds ever recorded by man](https://www.mountwashington.org/about-us/history/world-record-wind.aspx) for over 60 years. It just so happened that the day we went was absolutely beautiful. If it wasn't, however, this would be your last chance to turn back before reaching [the summit](/photos/mt-washington-cog-railway).
